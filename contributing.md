Shall this repo be a collective effort to understand (extend?) a well known static analyzer with great scalability starting from scratch!
Maybe something more in the future.

So we should write some rules here:
- Do not mess things up when committing!
- We can always clone the project to a new dedicated url if things become big.. right, you all hope this will never happen
